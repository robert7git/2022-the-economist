In a sudden and unexpected assault this month, Ukraine’s armed forces liberated thousands of square kilometres of territory, causing large parts of Russia’s invasion force to flee in disarray. Our editor-in-chief and senior editors discuss developments on the battlefield in Ukraine, reactions from Kyiv and Moscow, and whether this is indeed a turning point in the conflict. With Zanny Minton Beddoes, Edward Carr, Shashank Joshi and Arkady Ostrovsky.  Visit our subscriber events page to view the schedule for our forthcoming events.

In 1997 Britain handed Hong Kong back to China. China promised that Hong Kong would be governed for the next 50 years under the policy of “one country, two systems”, enshrining the freedoms Hong Kongers had enjoyed under British rule. Just 25 years later, those freedoms no longer exist. This film tracks how a free and open society became a police state within just a few years, and asks what it means for the rest of the world.

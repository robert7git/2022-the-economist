For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletter A week ago Boris Johnson was just about hanging on. Then in a hellish few days for Britain’s prime minister a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to announce his departure. A contest will now determine the next leader of the Conservative Party, and thus the country. A new prime minister—the country’s fourth in six years—will be in Downing Street by early September. So far 11 MPs have announced they are running (see chart). The list includes two former chancellors, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak, and the current one, Nadhim Zahawi. Jeremy Hunt, a former health and foreign secretary who ran against Mr Johnson in 2019, announced his bid on Saturday. Five women are in the race, including Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Penny Mordaunt, a trade minister. The three white men—Mr Hunt, Tom Tugendhat and Grant Shapps—have combined odds of just 13%. The next Tory leader is likely to be either Britain’s third female prime minister, its first ethnic-minority one or both. Three key metrics make Mr Sunak the frontrunner. First, he has attracted more endorsements, with 36, than any other candidate, according to a tally kept by Conservative Home, a website. Ms Mordaunt is in second place, with 21, followed by Tom Tugendhat, a prominent backbencher, with 18. Second, Mr Sunak is the highest rated among the wider public, making him an attractive option for party members worried about the next election. Third, punters on Smarkets, a betting exchange, make Mr Sunak the favourite, with a one-in-three chance. His nearest rival is Ms Mordaunt, at one-in-five. At the beginning of the leadership races in 2016 and 2019 Theresa May and Mr Johnson, who went on to win, had the same advantages. ■

The final episode in our three-part special series investigating the battle over what is taught in America’s public schools and asking how the anti-CRT movement became such a powerful social, legislative and political force in its own right. Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of teachers getting it wrong, there is little sign so far that CRT is causing widespread harm. What then explains the frenzy? The Economist’s Tamara Gilkes Borr speaks to a teacher in Tennessee who lost his job after getting caught up in the debate. She visits a seemingly unconnected hearing in the Arizona legislature and unearths something surprising. And she goes back to Christopher Rufo, one of the leaders of the anti-CRT movement, to find out what the connection is between his campaign and the push to increase school choice in America. Does the anti-CRT movement have a bigger target? Runtime: 50min  You can listen to the rest of this special series in full via the Checks and Balance homepage and sign up to our weekly newsletter.

For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to Off the Charts, our weekly newsletterJoe Biden is an unpopular president—and he is particularly unpopular among young voters. The Economist has analysed the last month of surveys conducted on our behalf by YouGov, a pollster, and found that only 57% of Democrats under the age of 30 say they “somewhat” or “strongly” approve of the job Mr Biden is doing. The group’s low ratings are a big reason why the president’s overall approval rating is just 38%. It is not that youngsters are abandoning the Democrats. Nearly 80% of young Democrats plan to vote for party’s candidates in November’s mid-term elections, and a plurality still call themselves “very” or “somewhat” liberal. Instead, our analysis of the data suggests two explanations for the trend. The first is that youngsters are less wedded to the party than their older compatriots. Two-thirds of Democrats over-65 call themselves “strong” Democrats; only 38% of those under 30 say the same. Young Americans are twice as likely as seniors to be categorised as “pure” independents—a growing group that does not lean to either party, but plants itself firmly in the middle. And given that partisanship correlates with loyalty to Mr Biden—approval of Mr Biden is 59% among weak Democrats, compared with 85% among the strongly attached—younger voters are naturally more likely to think poorly of the president. The second cause of the 79-year-old Mr Biden’s poor ratings is simpler: the young do not like old leaders. When YouGov asked respondents to tell them whether a Congressperson’s age “might make it too difficult to do the work congress requires”, some 35% of all Democrats agreed. But among under-30s, that rose to 45%. If the Democratic Party wants young people’s support, it ought to offer politicians closer to their age. ■

Britain’s Conservative party may be changing leadership, but it will take a lot more than that to change the country’s gloomy economic situation. Prices are rising at their fastest pace in 40 years–at one of the highest rates in the West. The cost of servicing the country’s ballooning debt has increased. And a recession is looming. On this week’s episode, hosts Soumaya Keynes, Alice Fulwood and Mike Bird investigate just what’s behind Britain’s growth crisis. First, they ask our Britain editor Andrew Palmer how much of the current situation is down to Boris Johnson’s government’s economic policies and the OBR’s David Miles explains how much space the incoming government has to cut taxes. Then, Anna Valero of London School of Economics explains what’s behind Britain’s tepid growth: a productivity crisis. The Economist’s Joshua Roberts shows venture capital’s role. Finally, they ask just what can be done to get Britain’s economy back on track.

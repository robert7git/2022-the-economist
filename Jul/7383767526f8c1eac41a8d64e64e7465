THE EVOLUTIONARY journey that created modern humans was once thought to be relatively linear. But new technology is revealing a far more complex picture. The Economist’s Dylan Barry travels to South Africa to trace the story of our evolution, and explains how interbreeding with other species provided the genes possessed by many people today.

We speak to the researchers who are helping to rewrite the human story. Alok Jha hosts.

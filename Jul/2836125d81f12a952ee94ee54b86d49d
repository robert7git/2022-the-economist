The Democratic party is in the throes of a rude awakening. Despite Donald Trump remaining at its head, the Republican Party is widely expected to make significant gains in the upcoming mid-term elections. Working class and Hispanic voters seem to be turning away from the Democrats. In some liberal cities, voters are in open revolt against progressive policies. How did the party lose touch with its voters? And does a flurry of recent dealmaking suggest it can moderate in time to avoid electoral disaster? Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, makes the case for progressive success beyond the mid-terms. We ask Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of “The New Politics of Evasion”, how the central myths of the Democratic party have changed. And Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman from Silicon Valley, argues for how to reframe the Democratic narrative. John Prideaux hosts with Idrees Kahloon and Charlotte Howard.

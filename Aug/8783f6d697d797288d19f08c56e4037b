Democrats have finally passed their climate, tax and health care legislation through the Senate. Chuck Schumer and his colleagues are toasting their successful out-manoeuvring of the GOP. How will the Inflation Reduction Act affect carbon emissions, prescription drug prices and the deficit? And will it improve voters’ views of Joe Biden and his party? The Economist’s Vijay Vaitheeswaran assesses the climate provisions in the bill. We go back to another occasion when Democrats had to go it alone in Congress. And The Economist’s Elliott Morris considers whether a legislative victory can change voters’ minds. John Prideaux hosts with Charlotte Howard and Idrees Kahloon.

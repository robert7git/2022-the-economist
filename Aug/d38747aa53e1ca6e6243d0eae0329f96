The second part of our occasional series on the race for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat. For now the campaign is largely happening online, with Democrat John Fetterman staying off the trail due to a health scare, and Republican Dr Oz failing to take advantage of the open lane. But away from the memes and internet stunts, what do voters actually want? Local journalist John Micek gives an update on the horse race. We go back to a sea-change moment in Pennsylvania’s electoral landscape. And The Economist’s Stevie Hertz heads into the Philadelphia suburbs to find out how voters are feeling with less than 100 days to go until the midterms. What can one state tell us about the national picture? John Prideaux hosts with Idrees Kahloon and Jon Fasman.

OUR SERIES on America’s mid-term elections begins with a visit to a citizenship class in Doral, Florida, given by Republicans. We examine how the GOP is cutting into Democrats’ advantage with Latino voters. Britain’s trial of a superhighway for drones is a bid to unleash their commercial potential. And meeting a Thai dissident issuing dystopian pop music from self-imposed exile. Runtime 24 mins.
